General Settings
W3TC generally works well with its default settings. So, we’ll primarily need to configure the General Settings page and not go into each individual feature area.

Visit the W3TC General Settings page. From the left sidebar, click Performance -> General Settings. We can perform high level set up here but then we’ll also do more detailed set up on individual settings pages. I leave off (unchecked) “Toggle all caching types on or off (at once)” in the general box.

Enable Page Cache with Opcode Alternative PHP Cache (APC):


Enable Minify with the following settings. I use manual mode because minify can break some themes if your settings are too aggressive (however, your chosen theme may work fine):


I leave unchecked/off Database Caching as this is recommended only if you do not activate Object Caching.

Enable the Object Cache:


Enable the Browser Cache:


Enable Reverse Proxy:

Configure W3TC to regularly purge the Varnish Cache from 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
