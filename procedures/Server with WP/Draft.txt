Underneath there's the entire procedure in case you want to know (i created one alias also to log-out):
1) Download PuTTY
2) Open in its folder puttygen
3) Insert the private key file (amazon-joshfolgado.pem) and turn it into aws.ppk
5) Connect to the instance using its Public DNS. Launch it.
    ec2-52-36-21-192.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
6) Enter with the username: ubuntu

Once i got in,
- Start with an update:
   sudo apt-get update

 - Do an upgrade before installing what we need:
  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

 - Install Apache
  sudo apt-get install apache2
 
 - Put the code bellow and see if it's installed
  Service apache2 start

   - Install a package that provides the PHP5 module for the Apache 2
   sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5

   - Restart Apache
  sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

   - Get the necessary premissions for changes made by our user
  sudo chmod ubuntu /var/www/html
   chmod 777 /var/www/html  (read write and execute)
   
   - Install cURL (i don't know if needed in wordpress, but if we want some e-commerce stuff, magento will need it)
    sudo apt-get install php5-curl

  - Install MySQL server:
  sudo apt-get install mysql-server
  user: root
  pw: xcvb1234

  - Install 
  sudo apt-get install php5-mysql

  - Install phpmyadmin
  sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin
  Webserver to reconfigure: Apache2
  (use the same user and pw that were written bellow)

  - Install
  sudo apt-get install  php5- mcrypt

So far all worked well, then was time for WP
[3/9/2016 11:54:44 AM] Tiago Peres: For the WP was faster,
-Get into the following folder:
cd /var/www/html

- There's an index.html file that must be erased because doesn't have anything to do with what we want
 rm index.html

- Now instead of using ftp, cause was slower, 
    wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz

- It appears an archive that doesn't have the right premissions, must chmod
 sudo chmod 777 latest.tar.gz
 ( the file that name, that was red, turned green)

- With the premissions on
tar xfz latest.tar.gz

 - cause i want WP as root,
  mv wordpress/* ./
