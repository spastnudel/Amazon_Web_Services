Install MySQL Server

Install the MySQL Server package:

sudo apt-get install mysql-server
You’ll be asked to provide a user name and password. Make note of your choices for use during the setup process.

Configure the MySQL Database. Change user name and password below to whatever you selected during the installation:

mysql -u root -p
create database wordpress;
grant all privileges on wordpress.* TO "your-mysql-username"@"localhost" identified by "your-mysql-password";
flush privileges;
exit;
Later, you will want to review securing your MySQL server. I have a short synopsis on my site here.
