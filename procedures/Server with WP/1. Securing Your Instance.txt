Securing Your Instance

While AWS provides its own firewall, there are still things you can do to minimize security risks. Here are three things I recommend:

1. Create an Alternate User Account to the Default root (ubuntu) Login
2. Turn off SSH Access for Default root (ubuntu) Account
3. Change the Default Port Used for SSH From 22
Warning: Please follow these directions extremely carefully. Deviating slightly from these steps may create problems - including even making your instance inaccessible.
